    "# K-means Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means is one of the simplest and widely used unsupervised machine learning algorithms that can partition a dataset into a set of non-overlapping subgroups, known as clusters. The objective is to find groups in the data, with the number of groups being represented by the variable \\( K \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does K-means work?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Randomly select \\( K \\) data points (seeds) to be the initial centroids.\n",
    "2. **Assignment**: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, and it will inherit that centroid's cluster label.\n",
    "3. **Update**: Calculate the new mean (centroid) for each cluster. This will be the mean of all the points assigned to that cluster.\n",
    "4. **Repeat**: Repeat the assignment and update steps iteratively until no improvement is made, meaning the assignments no longer change.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Points to Remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The outcome might differ based on the initial seeds. So, the algorithm might yield different results on different runs.\n",
    "- The value of \\( K \\) needs to be specified beforehand. One common method to find a reasonably good value of \\( K \\) is the \"Elbow Method\".\n",
    "- K-means is sensitive to the scale of the data. Hence, it's often recommended to scale your data before applying K-means clustering.\n",
    "- It's a linear clustering algorithm, meaning it works best when the clusters are spherical and equally sized.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means aims to minimize the total within-cluster variance, or, equivalently, the sum of squared distances from each point to its assigned center. Formally, if \\( c(i) \\) is the cluster to which instance \\( i \\) is assigned, and \\( \\mu_{c(i)} \\) is the centroid of cluster \\( c(i) \\), the objective \\( J \\) to be minimized is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ J = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} ||x^{(i)} - \\mu_{c(i)}||^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $$ x^{(i)} $$ is a data point.\n",
    "- $$ \\mu_{c(i)} $$ is the centroid of the assigned cluster for $$ x^{(i)} $$.\n",
    "- \\( m \\) is the number of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Not suitable for clusters with complex shapes and sizes.\n",
    "- Sensitivity to the initial placement of centroids.\n",
    "- It may not work well with clusters of different sizes and densities.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome some of these limitations, other algorithms like K-medoids, Hierarchical clustering, or DBSCAN can be considered."
