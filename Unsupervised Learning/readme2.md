# Dive into Unsupervised Learning with Python

Embrace the domain of unsupervised learning, where you'll explore the inherent patterns within data without explicit supervision. Harness the power of Python and its suite of libraries to uncover hidden structures, anomalies, and more.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes

### 1. Techniques of Unsupervised Learning
- Master the core techniques, such as:
  - **Clustering**: Identify inherent groupings within the data.
  - **Anomaly Detection**: Discover unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior.

### 2. Crafting Recommender Systems
- Get acquainted with the art of recommendation algorithms:
  - **Collaborative Filtering**: Predict a user's interests by collecting preferences from many users.
  - **Content-based Deep Learning**: Dive deep into the nuances of content-driven recommendation models using advanced deep learning techniques.

### 3. Introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning
- Build a foundational **Deep Reinforcement Learning model**, a type of algorithm that learns by interacting with an environment through observations, actions, and rewards.

Embark on this unsupervised journey, uncover the latent patterns in data, and build state-of-the-art systems without explicit labels!
